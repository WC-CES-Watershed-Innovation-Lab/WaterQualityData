# WaterQualityData

This repository has two functions: code sharing and website compiling.

data_from_hydrovu is the main codefile that forms the basis of this repo's functionality. With that program, we pull data from HydroVu and compile them into PyPlot graphs. Then, the program uploads PyPlot graph bit data to this GitHub repo.

The data folder stores the graph data by location, with a code file for each water quality parameter. The index.html file structures the graphs into an easy-to-navigate web interface.
